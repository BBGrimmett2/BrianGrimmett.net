							<h2>PowerPaddle</h2>
	
							<p>
								Using force sensors, Arduino, and python the PowerPaddle takes the force 
								exerted by a swimmer and allows them to use the data to fight weak points 
								in their stroke as well as finding ways to be more efficient. The PowerPaddle 
								also has applications in water safety to show people how to be more efficient 
								in swimming and giving them more information about how to use their bodies to 
								escape dangerous situations.

								<h3 class="major">Project Goals</h3>
	
								<p>
									The PowerPaddle’s goal is to be a device to help competitive swimmers to be 
									more efficient in their stroke. Using the article 
									
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Triathlon/News/Blogs/Multisport-Lab/2016/April/26/Measuring-Propulsive-Force-in-Swimming">Measuring Propulsive Force in Swimming</a>
									
									, written by Gary Hall Sr, the maximum propulsive force of the swimmer 
									happens as the hand is one foot in front of the shoulder joint. The PowerPaddle 
									is designed to go onto the hand and collect data while the swimmer is in motion, 
									then the software will delete any data that is below a certain threshold therefore 
									it is only collecting data while the stroke is underwater. The ultimate goal will 
									be for the PowerPaddle to be waterproof and allow the swimmer to have a minimal 
									difference in their stroke while wearing it. 
								</p>
	
								<h3>Technolgies Used:</h3>
									<ul class = "interest" style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li>Python</li>
	
										<li>Kivy</li>
	
										<li>Arduino</li>
									</ul>
								
									<p>
										Starting this project I felt extremely overwhelmed; however, my research 
										advisor helped me break down the project into smaller more achievable 
										“checkpoints”. The goals were as follows:

										<ol class="interest">
											<li>Research and engineering design</li>

											<li>Finalizing a prototype</li>
											
											<li>Build the initial design on a breadboard</li>

											<li>Application development</li>

											<li>Complete a dry mockup</li>

											<li>Waterproofing</li>

											<li>Pool trials</li>

											<li>Data collection</li>
										</ol>
									</p>

									<p>
										For the first goal, I sketched out where the force sensors will go as a 
										general idea, as well as what materials will be used. I decided to use a 
										force-sensitive resistor (FSR) from 
										
										<a target="_blank" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/166">Adafruit.com</a> 
										
										and an Arduino provided to me by the school. I chose the components by looking at a 
										
										<a target="_blank" href="https://csdt.org/culture/diysportsscience/diyjumpplate.html">jump plate</a>
										created by a basketball coach and modifying the idea for my application. Next, 
										I chose to use Python as it is easy to use and has intuitive GUIs such as Kivy. 
										
										<a target="_blank" href="https://kivy.org/#home">Kivy</a>
										
										has extensive documentation and a helpful online community which was my requirement when choosing a GUI. 
									</p>

									<p>
										In the first mockup, I was able to see the data being read by the FSR, which was very exciting for me to 
										see the mockup work. However, it seemed to have a “garbage” output which I was able to trace back to 
										floating-point number errors and trying to convert strings to numbers in data collection. After I was 
										able to collect data, I have created a formula to get accurate and precise measurements. This was 
										done by comparing data to lab force sensors with multiple different weights and items and finding 
										the factor that the force sensor was off. 
									</p>

									<p>
										As of now, I have been working on creating a computer model and downsizing the device. The goal 
										for the downsizing is to make the device more useable underwater. I look forward to continuing 
										my research at Roanoke College and working towards a more useable product!
