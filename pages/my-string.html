								, I created a clone that would enable me to have an easy way to store an array of 
								characters. The purpose of this project was to test my knowledge of the C++ language 
								in addition to the workings of class and user-designed data types.

								<h2 class="major">How it was done</h2>

								<h3 class="major">Project Goals</h3>
	
								<p>
									The goals for this project were to create a C++ string class that can be modified for 
									later projects and to have a deeper understanding of how the standard string library 
									was created while exploring user-defined data types. The requirements I set for this 
									project were for the class to have efficient memory allocation, input and output operators, 
									and other useful member functions/operators.
								</p>
	
								<h3>Technolgies Used:</h3>
									<ul class="interest" style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li>C++</li>

										<li>Makefile</li>
									</ul>
								
									<p>
										The first step of creating the class was to set the private variables which 
										include a variable to represent the array size, the total amount of memory allocated, 
										and an array of characters. Next was the default constructor where the array size is 
										set to zero, the memory allocation set to one, and the array of characters only including 
										the end of string character. To add characters to the array, the array size must be increased. 
										This presented a problem where when one memory allocation spot is added to the array then the 
										array must be resized using the new operator and the array must be copied. Doing this every time 
										a character is added is not efficient and can be very slow when the array grows large enough. 
										For this reason, i used array doubling for the memory allocation to have a more efficient and size-proof 
										system. Afterwards, I began adding member functions such as copyString, printLocation, subString, 
										addCharacter, removeCharacter, and many others that I thought would be useful to have. With the member 
										functions, I also added operators such as less than, greater than, equal to, equals, greater than or equal 
										to, less than or equal to, input, and output. Finally, a destructor was added to clear the heap space and 
										prevent memory leaks in programs. 
									</p>

									<p>
										To use the string class in C++ files, I worked with makefiles where 
										I used a simple C++ file to test the functionality of the member functions. 
										While programming the class, I was using hand tracing to debug the program and 
										reference my planning on paper to be sure everything is working to the the way in which I designed it.
									</p>

									<p>
										Overall, this project gave me a lot of experience working with custom data types and 
										debugging a project of this magnitude. Even though there are many of other programs that 
										are much larger than the one I wrote, the experience and habits of commenting and debugging 
										allowed me to practice “good coding habits” that will allow for other people to be able to 
										read and use my code.
