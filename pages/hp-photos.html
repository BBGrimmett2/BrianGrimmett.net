							<h2>Hannah Petty Photography</h2>
	
							<p>
								A photography website that uses HTML, PHP, and CSS to have a 
								center for the client’s business. The foundation of the 
								website was a template from W3 Schools, which was adopted for 
								the client’s needs. The website features an informational homepage 
								with pricing, a photo gallery, and a contact form. Where the 
								portfolio can take the user to a photoshoot detail page.

								<h3 class="major">Project Goals</h3>
	
								<p>
									The client wanted a webpage that serves as a hub for a photography 
									business. Through discussions with the client over a few meetings and 
									looking at other photography websites we created a plan for her website. 
									The client has also wanted me to be the one keeping the site updates where 
									they would send content and I would add it to the website.
								</p>
	
								<h3>Technolgies Used:</h3>
									<ul class = "interest" style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li>HTML</li>
	
										<li>CSS</li>
	
										<li>JavaScript</li>
	
										<li>PHP</li>
									</ul>
								
									<p>
										This project challenged me because I have worked with HTML, 
										PHP, and CSS before however, online documentation by 
										<a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">W3 schools</a> 

										made the project much easier and broke down the elements into easier-to-digest concepts. Therefore, I used a 

										<a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">template from W3 Schools</a>

										, and I was able to adapt the template to what the client was asking for. The first thing I tackled was 
										the home page which I took the template and modified it to include a pricing section, portfolio, and working 
										contact form. The contact form was a big challenge for me because I have not worked with PHP before; however, 
										thanks to a tutorial on YouTube by 
										
										<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/h5ghlfvU3S8">FollowAndrew</a>. 

										I was able to get the contact form working.I formatted the emails sent thru the contact 
										form to a contact email address set up through the website hosting service to be easily 
										readable and informative. 
									</p>

									<p>
										On the portfolio page, I was able to take the idea from the homepage 
										to have continuity throughout the website. The portfolio page is a picture 
										gallery in which when the user clicks on the desired picture it takes them 
										to a detail page about the shoot that contains some background information 
										on the photoshoot. The detail page also includes some featured photos from 
										the photoshoot for clients to see the photographer's work.
